The rtm_sim is an extremely simple application which reads a configuration
file, builds one or more route tables, and sends the table(s) to the
indicated applications.  The applications are assumed to be RMr based
applications which are listening either on a well known port (4561) for
table updates, or on a port which is indicated in the config file.

The sim is _not_ intended to be a complete replacement for any route
table mangager, but simply allows the ability to:

	1) ensure that the RMr based application can receive real-time
	   table updates (thus is configured correctly with the needed
	   port properly exposed via the container environment if
	   applicable).

	2) allow the generation of one or more route tables from a central
	   point during testing without having to run a more complicated
	   route manager for basic testing.
