This directory contains various sender/receiver applications that can be
driven together to test message exchange through the RMr library. 
The run_app_test.ksh script should support building the library, building
a sender and receiver, then running a short test to verify.

The basic sender and receiver
Sender and receiver perform lightweight check sums on the message body 
and on trace data to verify that the messages are being reeived correctly.
The receiver acks message type 5, so the reciver should receive acks at
about the volume of 1/10th the number of messages sent.


The contents of this directory are generally intended to support automated
testing via the run_all.sh script. Howerver, there may be times where
building and running the tools manually is needed. To support this two
scripts, maker.sh and runner.sh, are provided. The maker.sh script will
build RMR in ../../.build and install it in a /tmp directory so that the
needed include files can be found when building the test programmes. The
runner.sh script sets the environment and then starts the comand given.
For example, to run the sencder:
	RMR_SEED_RT=xx.rt runner.sh ./sender 1000 0 0

The runner script accepts both -v and -d to set verbose and debug options
for RMR when the programme is run.


The maker script will always build the test programmes whether they've been
changed or not.  By default the current .deb packages in ../../.build are
used, but the -b option can be given to force a rebuild of the RMR libraries
in addition to building the tools.  If the ../../.build directory does not
exist, it should automatically be created and RMR built.
