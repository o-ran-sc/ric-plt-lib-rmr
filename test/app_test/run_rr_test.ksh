#	Mnemonic:	run_multi_test.ksh
#	Abstract:	This is a simple script to set up and run the basic send/receive
#				processes for some library validation on top of nano/nng. This
#				particular tests starts several receivers and creates a route table
#				which causes messages to be sent round robin to all of the receivers.
#				The number of messages command line parameter (-n) will be the number
#				of messages that each receiver should expect; the sender will be asked
#				to send r times that many messages so that as they are round robbined
#				each receiver should get the same number of messages.
#
#				Example command line:
#					ksh ./run_rr_test.ksh		# default 10 messages at 1 msg/sec
#					ksh ./run_rr_test.ksh -N    # default but with nanomsg lib
#					ksh ./run_rr_test.ksh -d 100 -n 10000 # send 10k messages with 100ms delay between
