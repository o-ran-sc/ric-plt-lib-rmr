#	Mnemonic:	rebuild.ksh
#	Abstract:	This is a simple script that will cause RMr to be rebuilt. It
#				may be invoked by any of the run_* scripts in this directory.
#
#				NOTE:
#				The build path is echod onto stdout so that the caller is able
#				to reference build items for compile/linking. All other communication
#				should be directed to stderr.
