#	Mnemonic:	run_app_test.ksh
#	Abstract:	This is a simple script to set up and run the basic send/receive
#				processes for some library validation on top of nano/nng.
#				It should be possible to clone the repo, switch to this directory
#				and execute  'ksh run -B'  which will build RMr, make the sender and
#				recevier then  run the basic test.
#
#				Example command line:
#					ksh ./run_app_test.ksh		# default 20 messages at 2 msg/sec
#					ksh ./run_app_test.ksh -N    # default but with nanomsg lib
#					ksh ./run_app_test.ksh -d 100 -n 10000 # send 10k messages with 100ms delay between
