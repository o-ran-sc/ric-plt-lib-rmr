Directories within this directory contains collections of documents
such as the manual pages and main RMR user guide.   Three are some 
imbed files at this level which make setup to generate document 
output in different flavours (e.g. postscript and troff) possible.

For the most part, document output is genreated during the build
process and left at the top level build directory.  Manual pages
are the noted exception as the troff output is placed into the 
development pacage files and will be installed with the RMR library
(archive) such that the standard UNIX man command will generate
the needed documentation that develoers expect.
