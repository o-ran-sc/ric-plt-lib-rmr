Various RMr man pages. These are maintained in {X}fm format which allows
them to be rendered into one of these formats:
    Postscript
    troff
    rst
    markdown
    html


Troff is generated and installed into deb packages such that 'man rmr_call'
and the like generate expected man page output.  The rst output is likely
copied to some other directory and snarfed for automatic conversion to 
html ({X}fm could do that without the extra layer) as a part of the CICD
gizmo.   Postscript is a benefit for pretty printing, and markdown is 
available if someone adds a markdown macro file in the parent directory.
