&h1(Appendix  &gloss_appendix -- Glossary)

Many terms in networking can be interpreted with multiple meanings,
and several terms used in various RMR documentation are RMR specific.
The following definitions are the meanings of terms used within RMR
documentation and should help the reader to understand the intent of
meaning.

&beg_dlist( &1.0i Helvetica-bold : : 25,70 )
&ditem(application) A programme which uses RMR to send and/or receive
		   messages to/from another RMR based application.

&ditem(Critical error)	An error that RMR has encountered which will
			prevent further successful processing by
			RMR. Critical errors usually indicate that the
			application should abort.

&ditem(Endpoint) An RMR based application that is defined as being
			capable of receiving one or more types of
			messages (as defined by a &ital(routing key.)
			.sm )

&ditem(Environment variable) A key/value pair which is set externally
			to the application, but which is available to
			the application (and referenced libraries)
			through the &cw(getenv) system
			call. Environment variables are the main
			method of communicating information such as
			port numbers to RMR.

&ditem(Error) An abnormal condition that RMR has encountered, but will
			not affect the overall processing by RMR, but
			may impact certain aspects such as the ability
			to communicate with a specific endpoint.
			Errors generally indicate that something,
			usually external to RMR, must be addressed.

&ditem(Host name) The name of the host as returned by the
			&cw(gethostbyname) system call. In a
			containerised  environment this might be the
			container or service name depending on how the
			container is started. From RMR's point of
			view, a host name can be used to resolve an
			&ital(endpoint) definition in a &ital(route
			table.)

&ditem(IP)	Internet protocol. A low level transmission protocol
			which governs the transmission of datagrams
			across network boundaries.

&ditem(Listen socket) A &ital(TCP) socket used to await incoming
			connection requests. Listen sockets are
			defined by an interface and port number
			combination where the port number is unique
			for the interface.

&ditem(Message) A series of bytes transmitted from the application to
			another RMR based application. A message is
			comprised of RMR specific data (a header), and
			application data (a payload).

&ditem(Message buffer) A data structure used to describe a message
			which is to be sent or has been received. The
			message buffer includes the payload length,
			message type, message source, and other
			information.

&ditem(Message type) A signed integer (0-32000) which identifies the
			type of message being transmitted, and is one
			of the two components of a &ital(routing key.)
			See &ital(Subscription ID.)

&ditem(Payload) The portion of a message which holds the user data to
			be transmitted to the remote &ital(endpoint.)
			The payload contents are completely
			application defined.

&ditem(RMR context) A set of information which defines the current
			state of the underlying transport connections
			that RMR is managing. The application will be
			give a context reference (pointer) that is
			supplied to most RMR functions as the first
			parameter.

&ditem(Round robin) The method of selecting an &ital(endpoint) from a
			list such that all &ital(endpoints) are
			selected before starting at the head of the list.

&ditem(Route table) A series of "rules" which define the possible
			&ital(endpoints) for each &ital(routing key.)

&ditem(Route table manager) An application responsible for building a
			&ital(route table) and then distributing it to
			all applicable RMR based applications.

&ditem(Routing) The process of selecting an &ital(endpoint) which will
			be the recipient of a message.

&ditem(Routing key) A combination of &ital(message type) and
			&ital(subscription ID) which RMR uses to
			select the destination &ital(endpoint) when
			sending a message.

&ditem(Source) The sender of a message.


&ditem(Subscription ID) A signed integer value (0-32000) which
			identifies the subscription characteristic of
			a message. It is used in conjunction with the
			&ital(message type) to determine the
			&ital(routing key.)

&ditem(Target) The &ital(endpoint) selected to receive a message.

&ditem(TCP)	Transmission Control Protocol. A connection based
			internet protocol which provides for lossless
			packet transportation, usually over IP.

&ditem(Thread)	Also called a &ital(process thread, or pthread.)  This
			is a lightweight process which executes in
			concurrently with the application and shares
			the same address space. RMR uses threads to
			manage asynchronous functions such as route
			table updates.

&ditem(Trace information)  An optional portion of the message buffer
			that the application may populate with data
			that allows for tracing the progress of the
			transaction or application activity across
			components. RMR makes no use of this data.

&ditem(Transaction ID) A fixed number of bytes in the &ital(message
			buffer) which the application may populate
			with information related to the
			transaction. RMR makes use of the transaction
			ID for matching response messages with the
			&c(rmr_call) function is used to send a
			message.

&ditem(Transient failure) An error state that is believed to be short
			lived and that the operation, if retried by
			the  application, might be successful. C
			programmers will recognise this as
			&cw(EAGAIN.)

&ditem(Warning) A warning occurs when RMR has encountered something
			that it believes isn't correct, but has a
			defined work round.

&ditem(Wormhole) A direct connection managed by RMR between the user
			application and a remote, RMR based, application.
