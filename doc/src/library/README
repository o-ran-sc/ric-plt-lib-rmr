This directory contains the main RMR library documentation
such as the user guide and any internal doc; all of which will
likely share a common set of figures, glossary, and index
lists.  The "main" for each doc is the single .xfm file and
all modules are contained in .im files to allow sharing between
documents as makes sense (e.g. glossary).

Illustrations are all located in the ./figures directory and
are created as .fig files [1] which describe drawings using an
open ASCII format (rather than as a binary and/or proprietary
description). ASCII descriptions are easily maintained as
source code to track changes and revert when necessary.
A Dockerfile in the tools directory can be used to build a
"development image" with all of the tools needed to render
the PNG and encapsulated postscript derivations from the ASCII
descriptions.  Use of this image is not required, but might be
needed if a development environment doesn't provide Xfig and
the related tools.

[1]
	De facto standard tools for creating and managing .fig files:

	Install Xfig on a Linux system with:
		apt-get install xfig     (ubuntu-ish)
		zypper install xfig      (OpenSuse)

	The fig2dev tool is used to "batch" process .fig files in
	order to generate desired output (.eps, .png, etc.). These
	can be installed with commands such as:
		apt-get install fig2dev
		zypper install transfig
