.** example sender code

&h2(Receiver Sample)
The receiver code is even simpler than the sender code as it does not
need to wait for a route table to arrive (only senders need to do
that), nor does it need to allocate an initial buffer.  The example
assumes that the sender is transmitting a zero terminated string as
the payload.
