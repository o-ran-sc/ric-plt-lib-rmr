This directory contains source for the project mandated "read the
docs" .rst documentation.  If the "tfm" tool is available, the
Makefile will both build the doc from the source here and "install" it
into the docs directory at the repo root.  Then the generated .rst
files must be checked into the repo and committed with changes to the
source (maybe not the best practice).

The command 'make all' should be all that is needed to build the 
rtd documentation. Follow that with 'make publish' to actually move
the .rst files into the docs directory at the root; only the changed
files are moved.

Adding A New Man Page
When a new manual page is added to the source (../man), it must be 
added to the list in the user's guide source in this directory.

Rationale
Documentation is just code, and by maintaining the documentation as
source is is possible to generate various forms of output with a 
single make.  While it is possible to convert X to Y, a true document
composition language is far better at generating readable Postscript
output with embedded figures as well as text and tables. 

CAUTION:
The RST syntax is as bad as python when it comes to dealing with
spaces.  For example &bold( foo ) will insert spaces after the initial
bold trigger, and before the trailing bold trigger which will throw
the tox validation into a tizzy.  Further,  something like 'void *' 
and 'rmr_ '  does as well.  If needed, use the defined escape macro
to add an escape in such situations; it should only generate for RST
and not impact other output formats.
