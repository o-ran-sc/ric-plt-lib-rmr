This directory contains source for the project mandated "read the docs"
.rst documentation.  The Makefile will both build the doc from the source
here and "install" it into the docs directory at the repo root.  While 
it is not good practice, the generated .rst files must be checked into
the repo and committed with changes to the source.  

The command 'make all' should be all that is needed to build the 
rtd documentation.

Rationale
Documentation is just code, and by maintaining the documentation as
source is is possible to generate various forms of output with a 
single make.  While it is possible to convert X to Y, a true document
composition language is far better at geneating readable Postscript
output with embedded figures as well as text and tables. 

CAUTION:
The RST syntax is as bad as python when it comes to dealing with
spaces.  For example &bold( foo ) will insert spaces after the initial
bold trigger, and before the trailing bold trigger which will throw
the tox validation into a tizzy.  Further,  something like 'void *' 
and 'rmr_ '  does as well.  If needed, use the defined escape macro
to add an escape in such situations; it should only generate for RST
and not impact other output formats.
