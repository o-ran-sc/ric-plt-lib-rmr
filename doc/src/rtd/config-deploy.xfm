&h1(Overview)

The RIC Message Router (RMR) is a library for peer-to-peer
communication.  Applications use the library to send and receive
messages where the message routing and endpoint selection is based on
the message type rather than DNS host name-IP port combinations.
&space
This document contains information regarding the configuration of RMR
when it is embedded by a &ital(user application).  RMR itself is a
library, not a deployable entity.

&h2(Configuration)

Many aspects of RMR behavior are controlled via environment variables.
These values are read when a user application invokes the RMR
initialization function.  This allows these variables to be set before
the application is started as a function of the true environment, or
set by the application as a means for the application to influence
RMR's behaviour.  The following is a list of environment variables
which RMR recognizes. Also see the main RMR manual page in the
development package for more details.
