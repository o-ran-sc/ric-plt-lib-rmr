&h1(RMR Release Notes)
The following is a list of release highlights for the RMR library.
At one point in time the RMR repo also housed a wrapper library with a
separate version and release cycle.
This resulted in &ital(leap frogging) versions for each package; the
RMR core library was assigned odd major numbers (e.g. 3.1.0).
When the wrapper code was moved to a different repo the need to leap frog
versions ceased, and beginning with version 4.0.0, the RMR versions should
no longer skip.
