Documentation for RMr.

Most (all?) documentation for RMr is built from source ({X)fm, or other text
formatter source, not the RMr code) rather than hand editing the output 
(markdown/rst) files.  This allows for more control over the output, a wider 
variety of output types, and (most importantly) the generation of multiple 
output from the same source (e.g. man pages can be rendered in troff which 
the man command required, and also rendered as .rst or .md files which some 
wikis prefer, and as PDF which can be easily distributed).

Thus, there is a source file below this directory which has the document
source.  There may also be an output directory at this level. If necessary, 
the output directory will contain generated documents (.rst files?) which for
some odd reason need to also be committed to the repo (I don't commit binaries
so I'm having a difficult time sorting out the reason why these generated files
might be committed).
