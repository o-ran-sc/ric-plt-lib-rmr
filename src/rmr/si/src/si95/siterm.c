*  Mnemonic:	SIterm
*  Abstract:	Manage the transport provider block information relating to
*				the need to terminate the session. The block is left in the
*				list; it is unsafe to clean the lsit up outside of the SIwait 
*				thread.  When safe, the SIrm_tpb() function can be called to
*				do the rest of the work that was originally done by SIterm.

	the connection may need to be aborted. For this reason, the function name is
	lower case indicating that user programmes are discouraged from using this
