SI95 is a port of a lightweight TCP|UDP/IP communications library
originally called Socket Interface and was written in 1995. For
use by RMR as an integrated transport layer it has been dubbed
SI95, and unneeded features (UDP, multicast, child process support)
have been removed.  The orignal code was released into the public
domain (open source) with a 2-part BSD style license; the orignal 
authors have allowed the Apache license covering RMR to replace
the original license text in each file provided that the original
file headers are left to document the origin of the source. 

The library is constructed as an integrated set of externally visible
functions within the RMR library (librmr_si), however there is no
plan to make any SI95 headers directly available in the RMR development
package; in other words, it will be difficult for a user application
to make use of SI95 directly.

All external SI95 functions will retain their original SI prefix (e.g.
SIsendt).
