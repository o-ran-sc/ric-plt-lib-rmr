This directory contains the source for any support tools which
are distributed with the RMR runtime package.  Support tools
might provide means to query information about an RMR based
application using the RMR_CTL_PORT.

Support tools:
	health_ck	-- A generic health check application which
				sends n messages to the application running
				at the indicated host:port and expects to
				receive n responses. Exit code is a simple
				binary: 0 == received responses, 1 == failure.


Support tools are automatically built and included in the 
runtime package (deb or rpm).
