The RMR library was originally named Uta, and several of the now
static functions were originally a part of the API and thus they
retain the uta_ prefix.  When renaming the library, and thus shifting
the prefix to rmr_, the decision was made to keep the internal names
unchanged.

The original library was built on top of Nanomsg, and eventually ported
to NNG.  Sadly, the differences between Nanomsg and NNG were significant
enough (mostly the change from an integer file descriptor to a struct, 
return code shifts, and seemingly disassociation from errno) made the
port a bit messier than just switching nn_ prefixes to nng_.  The code
was reorganised to keep the nano/nng references as isolated as possible
and thus we have three sets of files:

Nanomsg specific:
	rma_private.h
	rma.c
	rtable_static.c

NNG Specific:
	rma_nng_private.h
	rma_nng.c
	rtable_nng_static.c

Transport Agnostic:
	ring_static.c
	rt_generic_static.c
	symtab.c
	tools_static.c


We assume that support for Nanomsg will be dropped at somepoint and 
because of that we decided to completely separate the nng/nano code
into self contained modules to make that deprecation easier, even
though there is some duplication between the modules (and to avoid
a sleu of ifdefs which just make the code impossible to read, and 
lead to bugs).
