# CI to verify the RMR library and build run-time and dev packages
# Inherits C toolchain from buildpack-deps:stretch
# Adds cmake ksh and alien for RMR

FROM buildpack-deps:stretch
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -q -y install cmake ksh alien
ADD . /tmp
WORKDIR /tmp

# build RMr, run unit tests, and generate packages and package lists
RUN ksh ci/ci_build.ksh

# Executing the container "as a binary" will cause the CI publish
# script to execute.  This will take the simple package list generated
# by the ci_build script and copy the list of packages to the target
# directory.  The target directory is /data by default, but can be
# overridden from the docker run command line. In either case, the 
# assumption is that the target directory is mounted as a volume, and
# that the user 'nobody' has write permissions.
