2021 April 9; version 4.7.2
	Ensure that route table update received from route generator is not
	applied before a full route table is received.

2021 April 2; version 4.7.1
	Correct issues found during static code analysis.

2021 March 31; version 4.7.0
	The route table collector thread will capture the current "offering"
	from the Route Manager (table generator) if the RMR_SEED_RT environment
	variable is set.

2021 March 10; version 4.6.1
	Corrected unit test "framework" to make manual testing easier, and to
	add the ability to set the code optimisation level via the CMake
	command line parameter OPT_LEVEL=n.

2021 February 22; Version 4.6.0
	Enhanced to use millisecond based timestamps when writing log messages.
	(RIC-627)

	Enhanced to eliminate the  reqirement that the file specified by the
	RMR_VCTL_FILE environment variable exist when RMR is initialised. RMR
	will correctly find this file if it is created after initialisation.
	Further, if the environment variable is not given, the user may create
	and populate /tmp/rmr.v at any time and the contents of this file will
	be used as if it were supplied via the environment variable. This should
	make debugging in existing containers easier.

	Enhanced to send an alarm manager when the user application is not
	receiving messages fast enough.  The original messages written to
	the standard error are still generated. (RIC-204)

2021 January 21; Version 4.5.2
	Fixes the excessive TCP session bug when sending to a slow receiver
	and a related segment fault because of too many open file descriptors.

	arrive in quick succession.  (RIC-674)

2020 October 30; Version 4.3.1
	Changes to address code analyser scans and two bug fixes identified
	while addressing the analysis data. (RIC-673)

	supplied).  (RIC-630)

2020 July 21; Version 4.1.4
	Fix bug in SI95 -- possible use of pointer after free (RIC-626).

2020 July 9; version 4.1.3
	Allow RTS messages to be sent before the arrival of the initial
	route table. Calls to RTS (heart beat responses) prior to the
	initial route table load could cause a crash if a framework
	blindly assumes that RTS is valid. (RIC-589)

2020 June 22; version 4.1.2

	issue. (RIC-355)

2020 April 29; version 4.0.4
	Fix the traffic steering message type constants (again) (RIC-342)

2020 April 28; version 4.0.3
	Fix sonar flagged bugs (RIC-78)

2020 April 24; version 4.0.2
	Correct bug in SI95 transport header length validation (RIC-341)

2020 April 22; version 4.0.1
	Correct message type constant for Traffic Steering predication (RIC-342)

2020 April 21; version 4.0.0
	The NNG based libraries are no longer included in the RMR packages.
	This is considered a breaking change as NNG will not be supported by
	default.  It is still possible to build with RMR-NNG libraries, but
	that is the exception.  The API between 3.8.2 and 4.0.0 is the SAME.
	Upgrading to 4.0.0 only means that the underlying transport mechanism
	is limited only to SI95.

	The rmr_rcv_specific() function has been deprecated as it was necessary
	only for NNG and Nanomsg support.  Its use should be discontinued.

2020 April 14; version 3.7.3
	Fix bug in rmr_call() when using SI95  (RIC-333)

2020 April 10; version 3.7.2
	Fix bug related to static route table only mode (RIC-331)

2020 April 9; version 3.7.1
	The max length restriction for receiving messages when using SI95 has
	been removed.  The length supplied during initialisation is used as
	the "normal maximum" and default buffer allocation size, but messages
	arriving which are larger are accepted. (RIC-309)

2020 April 7; version 3.7.0
	The health check support programme was renamed to rmr_probe (RIC-308).

2020 April 6; version 3.6.6

2020 March 10; version 3.5.1
	Add missing health check message types.

2020 March 9; version 3.5.0
	Added new wormhole send function: rmr_wh_call().

2020 March 6; version 3.4.0
	Add new wormhole state function: rmr_wh_state().

2020 March 5; Version 3.3.1
	Correct several "bugs" identified by automatic code analysis.

2020 March 4; Version 3.3.0

	had disconnected. (RIC-207).

2020 February 6; version 3.1.2
	Fix disconnection detection bug in interface to SI95.

2020 January 31; verison 3.1.1

	Correct documentation and missing rel-notes update for RTD.

2019 December 6; version 1.13.0
	Add ability to route messages based on the MEID in a message combined
	with the message type/subscription-ID.

	Fix bug in payload reallocation function; correct length of payload
	was not always copied.

2019 November 13; version 1.12.1
	New message type constants added to support A1.

2019 November 4; version 1.11.0
	Version bump to move away from the 1.10.* to distinguish between
	release A and the trial.

2019 November 7; version 1.12.0
	Version cut to support continued development for next release
	preserving the 1.11.* versions for release 1 (Amber) and
	related fixes.

2019 October 31; version 1.10.2
	Provide the means to increase the payload size of a received message
	without losing the data needed to use the rmr_rts_msg() funciton.

2019 October 21; version 1.10.1
	Fix to prevent null message buffer from being returned by the timeout
	receive function if the function is passed one to reuse.

2019 October 21; version 1.10.1
	Add periodic dump of send count info to stderr.

2019 September 27; version 1.9.0
	Python bindings added receive all queued function and corrected a unit test

2019 September 25; version 1.8.3
	Correct application level test issue causing timing problems during
	jenkins verification testing at command and merge

	Handle the NNG connection shutdown status which may now be
	generated when a connection throug a proxy is reset.

2019 September 25; version 1.8.2
	Correct bug in rmr_torcv_msg() when timeout set to zero (0).

2019 September 19; version 1.8.1
	Correct missing constant for wrappers.

2019 September 19; version 1.8.0
	New message types added:
		RAN_CONNECTED, RAN_RESTARTED, RAN_RECONFIGURED

2019 September 17; version 1.7.0
	Initial connection mode now defaults to asynchronous. Set RMR_ASYNC_CONN=0
	in the environment before rmr_init() is invoked to revert to
	synchronous first TCP connections. (Recovery connection attempts
	have always been asynchronous).

2019 September 3; version 1.6.0
	Fix bug in the rmr_rts_msg() function. If a return to sender message
	failed, the source IP address was not correctly adjusted and could
	cause the message to be "reflected" back to the sender on a retry.

	Added the ability to set the source "ID" via an environment var
	(RMR_SRC_ID).  When present in the environment, the string will
	be placed in to the message header as the source and thus be used
	by an application calling rmr_rts_smg() to return a response to
	the sender.  If this environment variable is not present, the host
	name (original behaviour) is used.

2019 August 26; version 1.4.0
	New message types were added.

2019 August 16; version 1.3.0
	New mesage types added.

2019 August 13; version 1.2.0 (API change, non-breaking)
	The function rmr_get_xact() was added to proide a convenient
	way to extract the transaction field from a message.

2019 August 8; version 1.1.0 (API change)
	This change should be backward compatable/non-breaking
	A new field has been added to the message buffer (rmr_mbuf_t).
	This field (tp_state) is used to communicate the errno value
	that the transport mechanism might set during send and/or
	receive operations.  C programmes should continue to use
	errno directly, but in some environments wrappers may not be
	able to access errno and this provides the value to them.
	See the rmr_alloc_msg manual page for more details.

2019 August 6; version 1.0.45 (build changes)
	Support for the Nanomsg transport library has been dropped.
		The library librmr.* will no longer be included in packages.

	Packages will install RMR libraries into the system preferred
		target directory. On some systems this is /usr/local/lib
		and on others it is /usr/local/lib64.  The diretory is
		determined by the sytem on which the package is built and
		NOT by the system installing the package, so it's possible
		that the RMR libraries end up in a strange location if the
		.deb or .rpm file was generated on a Linux flavour that
		has a different preference than the one where the package
		is installed.

2019 August 6; version 1.0.44 (API change)
	Added a new message type constant.

2019 July 15; Version 1.0.39 (bug fix)
	Prevent unnecessary usleep in retry loop.

2019 July 12; Version 1.0.38 (API change)
	Added new message types to RIC_message_types.h.

2019 July 11; Version 1.0.37

	librmr and librmr_nng
		- Add message buffer API function rmr_trace_ref()
		  (see rmr_trace_ref.3 manual page in dev package).
