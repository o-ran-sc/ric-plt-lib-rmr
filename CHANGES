2019 August 6; version 1.0.45 (build changes)
	Support for the Nanomsg transport library has been dropped.
		The library librmr.* will no longer be included in packages.

	Packages will install RMR libraries into the system preferred
		target directory. On some systems this is /usr/local/lib
		and on others it is /usr/local/lib64.  The diretory is
		determined by the sytem on which the package is built and
		NOT by the system installing the package, so it's possible
		that the RMR libraries end up in a strange location if the
		.deb or .rpm file was generated on a Linux flavour that
		has a different preference than the one where the package
		is installed.
