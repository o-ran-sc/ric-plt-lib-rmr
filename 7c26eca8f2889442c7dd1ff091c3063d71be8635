      "message": "I understand that get_default_ip will return the first IP in the list of IPs returned by mk_ip_list(). In dual-stack the lookup probably doesn\u0027t work very predictable (assuming that interfaces have IP v4 and IPv6 addresses assigned). So, I see this primarily used with “RMR_BIND_IF” being set to a concrete (IPv4 or IPv6) IP address - in which case  mk_ip_list() anyway only returns exactly the IP address given in the environment variable. And I understand that case worked with IPv6 already. Now the only added case that works seems to be an IPv6-only stack. I am fine with that. Maybe one more comment explaining this here (where we have the ‘[‘ comparison) would keep this more maintainable without now trying to invent some elaborate scheme to select IPv4 vs IPv6 in dual-stack environments. Let me know if I misunderstood the logic here.",
