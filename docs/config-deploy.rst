RMR CONFIGURATION AND DEPLOYMENT
================================

The RIC Message Router (RMR) is a library for peer-to-peer 
communication. Applications use the library to send and 
receive messages where the message routing and endpoint 
selection is based on the message type rather than DNS host 
name-IP port combinations. 
 
This document contains information regarding the 
configuration of RMR when it is embedded by a *user 
application* . RMR itself is a library, not a deployable 
entity. 


Configuration
-------------

Many aspects of RMR behavior are controlled via environment 
variables. These values are read when a user application 
invokes the RMR initialization function. This allows these 
variables to be set before the application is started as a 
function of the true environment, or set by the application 
as a means for the application to influence RMR's behaviour. 
The following is a list of environment variables which RMR 
recognizes. Also see the main RMR manual page in the 
development package for more details. 
 
   .. list-table:: 
     :widths: auto 
     :header-rows: 0 
     :class: borderless 
      
     * - **RMR_ASYNC_CONN** 
       - 
         Allows the async connection mode to be turned off (by setting 
         the value to 0). When set to 1, or missing from the 
         environment, RMR will invoke the connection interface in the 
         transport mechanism using the non-blocking (async) mode. This 
         will likely result in many "soft failures" (retry) until the 
         connection is established, but allows the application to 
         continue unimpeded should the connection be slow to set up. 
          
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_BIND_IF** 
       - 
         This provides the interface that RMR will bind listen ports 
         to, allowing for a single interface to be used rather than 
         listening across all interfaces. This should be the IP 
         address assigned to the interface that RMR should listen on, 
         and if not defined RMR will listen on all interfaces. 
          
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_CTL_PORT** 
       - 
         This variable defines the port that RMR should open for 
         communications with Route Manager, and other RMR control 
         applications. If not defined, the port 4561 is assumed. 
          
         Previously, the ``RMR_RTG_SVC`` (route table generator 
         service port) was used to define this port. However, a future 
         version of Route Manager will require RMR to connect and 
         request tables, thus that variable is now used to supply the 
         Route Manager's well-known address and port. 
          
         To maintain backwards compatibility with the older Route 
         Manager versions, the presence of this variable in the 
         environment will shift RMR's behaviour with respect to the 
         default value used when ``RMR_RTG_SVC`` is **not** defined. 
          
         When ``RMR_CTL_PORT`` is **defined:** RMR assumes that Route 
         Manager requires RMR to connect and request table updates is 
         made, and the default well-known address for Route manager is 
         used (routemgr:4561). 
          
         When ``RMR_CTL_PORT`` is **undefined:** RMR assumes that 
         Route Manager will connect and push table updates, thus the 
         default listen port (4561) is used. 
          
         To avoid any possible misinterpretation and/or incorrect 
         assumptions on the part of RMR, it is recommended that both 
         the ``RMR_CTL_PORT`` and ``RMR_RTG_SVC`` be defined. In the 
         case where both variables are defined, RMR will behave 
         exactly as is communicated with the variable's values. 
          
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_RTG_SVC** 
       - 
         The value of this variable depends on the Route Manager in 
         use. 
          
         When the Route Manager is expecting to connect to an xAPP and 
         push route tables, this variable must indicate the 
         ``port`` which RMR should use to listen for these 
         connections. 
          
         When the Route Manager is expecting RMR to connect and 
         request a table update during initialisation, the variable 
         should be the ``host`` of the Route Manager process. 
          
         The ``RMR_CTL_PORT`` variable (added with the support of 
         sending table update requests to Route manager), controls the 
         behaviour if this variable is not set. See the description of 
         that variable for details. 
          
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_HR_LOG** 
       - 
         By default RMR writes messages to standard error (incorrectly 
         referred to as log messages) in human readable format. If 
         this environment variable is set to 0, the format of standard 
         error messages might be written in some format not easily 
         read by humans. If missing, a value of 1 is assumed. 
          
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_LOG_VLEVEL** 
       - 
         This is a numeric value which corresponds to the verbosity 
         level used to limit messages written to standard error. The 
         lower the number the less chatty RMR functions are during 
         execution. The following is the current relationship between 
         the value set on this variable and the messages written: 
          
             .. list-table:: 
               :widths: auto 
               :header-rows: 0 
               :class: borderless 
                
               * - **0** 
                 - 
                   Off; no messages of any sort are written. 
                    
                    
                   | 
                
               * - **1** 
                 - 
                   Only critical messages are written (default if this variable 
                   does not exist) 
                    
                    
                   | 
                
               * - **2** 
                 - 
                   Errors and all messages written with a lower value. 
                    
                    
                   | 
                
               * - **3** 
                 - 
                   Warnings and all messages written with a lower value. 
                    
                    
                   | 
                
               * - **4** 
                 - 
                   Informational and all messages written with a lower value. 
                    
                    
                   | 
                
               * - **5** 
                 - 
                   Debugging mode -- all messages written, however this requires 
                   RMR to have been compiled with debugging support enabled. 
                    
          
          
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_RTG_ISRAW** 
       - 
         **Deprecated.** Should be set to 1 if the route table 
         generator is sending "plain" messages (not using RMR to send 
         messages), 0 if the RTG is using RMR to send. The default is 
         1 as we don't expect the RTG to use RMR. 
          
         This variable is only recognised when using the NNG transport 
         library as it is not possible to support NNG "raw" 
         communications with other transport libraries. It is also 
         necessary to match the value of this variable with the 
         capabilities of the Route Manager; at some point in the 
         future RMR will assume that all Route Manager messages will 
         arrive via an RMR connection and will ignore this variable. 
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_SEED_RT** 
       - 
         This is used to supply a static route table which can be used 
         for debugging, testing, or if no route table generator 
         process is being used to supply the route table. If not 
         defined, no static table is used and RMR will not report 
         *ready* until a table is received. The static route table may 
         contain both the route table (between newrt start and end 
         records), and the MEID map (between meid_map start and end 
         records). 
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_SRC_ID** 
       - 
         This is either the name or IP address which is placed into 
         outbound messages as the message source. This will used when 
         an RMR based application uses the rmr_rts_msg() function to 
         return a response to the sender. If not supplied RMR will use 
         the hostname which in some container environments might not 
         be routable. 
          
         The value of this variable is also used for Route Manager 
         messages which are sent via an RMR connection. 
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_VCTL_FILE** 
       - 
         This supplies the name of a verbosity control file. The core 
         RMR functions do not produce messages unless there is a 
         critical failure. However, the route table collection thread, 
         not a part of the main message processing component, can 
         write additional messages to standard error. If this variable 
         is set, RMR will extract the verbosity level for these 
         messages (0 is silent) from the first line of the file. 
         Changes to the file are detected and thus the level can be 
         changed dynamically, however RMR will only suss out this 
         variable during initialisation, so it is impossible to enable 
         verbosity after startup. 
          
         | 
      
     * - **RMR_WARNINGS** 
       - 
         If set to 1, RMR will write some warnings which are 
         non-performance impacting. If the variable is not defined, or 
         set to 0, RMR will not write these additional warnings.
