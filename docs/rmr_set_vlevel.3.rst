rmr_set_vlevel 
 
SYNOPSIS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
:: 
  
 #include <rmr/rmr.h>
 #include <rmr/rmr_logging.h>
 void rmr_set_vlevel( int new_level )
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The rmr_set_vlevel allows the user programme to set the 
verbosity level which is used to determine the messages RMR 
writes to standard error. The new_vlevel value must be one of 
the following constants which have the indicated meanings: 
 
 
RMR_VL_OFF 
   
  Turns off all message writing. This includes the stats and 
  debugging messages generated by the route collector thread 
  which are normally affected only by the externally managed 
  verbose level file (and related environment variable). 
   
 
RMR_VL_CRIT 
   
  Write only messages of critical importance. From the point 
  of view of RMR, when a critical proper behaviour of the 
  library cannot be expected or guaranteed. 
 
RMR_VL_ERR 
   
  Include error messages in the output. An error is an event 
  from which RMR has no means to recover. Continued proper 
  execution is likely except where the affected connection 
  and/or component mentioned in the error is concerned. 
 
RMR_VL_WARN 
   
  Include warning messages in the output. A warning 
  indicates an event which is not considered to be normal, 
  but is expected and continued acceptable behaviour of the 
  system is assured. 
 
RMR_VL_INFO 
   
  Include informational messagees in the output. 
  Informational messages include some diagnostic information 
  which explain the activities of RMR. 
 
RMR_VL_DEBUG 
   
  Include all debugging messages in the output. Debugging 
  must have also been enabled during the build as a 
  precaution to accidentally enabling this level of output 
  as it can grossly affect performance. 
 
 
Generally RMR does not write messages to the standard error 
device from *critical path* functions, therefore it is 
usually not harmful to enable a verbosity level of either 
RMR_VL_CRIT or RMR_VL_ERR. 
 
Messages written from the route table collection thread are 
still governed by the value placed into the verbose level 
control file (see the man page for rmr_init()); those 
messages are affected only when logging is completely 
disabled by passing RMR_VL_OFF to this function. 
 
The verbosity level can also be set via an environment 
variable prior to the start of the RMR based application. The 
environment variable is read only during initialisation; if 
the programme must change the value during execution, this 
function must be used. The default value, if this function is 
never called, and the environment variable is not present, is 
RMR_VL_ERR.
